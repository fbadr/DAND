# Data Analyst Nanodegree - Udacity

Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree projects


## Term1
### Intro Project0: Explore Weather Trends

This project will introduce you to the SQL and how to download data
from a database.

Youâ€™ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare
the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.


### Project1: Explore US Bikeshare Data

Use Python to answer interesting questions about bikeshare trip data collected
from three US cities.

Write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics,
and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents
the answers to your questions.

### Project2: Investigate a Dataset

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it
using NumPy and pandas.

Complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question
and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Project3: Analyze A/B Test Results

Understand test results of A/B test run by an e-commerce
website.


## Term2

### Project0: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

Compute descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze
the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

Communicate your understanding of the data and use statistical
inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### Project1: Explore and Summarize Data

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore
a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### Project2: Wrangle and Analyze Data

Using Python and its libraries, gather data from a variety of sources
and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

Document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase
them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries)
and/or SQL.

### Project3: Create a Tableau Story

Create a data visualization, using Tableau, from a data set that tells
a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data.

Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data
visualization, harnessing visual encodings and design principles
for effective communication.
